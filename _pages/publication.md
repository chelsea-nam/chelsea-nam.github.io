## Example data from the PISTON 2018 project

<img src="/assets/piston_example.png" width="90%" alt="PISTON Data"></div>
<p><small><italic> Colored circles in (a) are the evolution of the hourly median
reflectivity profile from gridded SEA-POL data. Contoured in
black are the relative radial winds of Typhoon Kong-Rey
derived from the thermodynamic profiles exceeding 20 m s-1.
(b)–(h) Vertical dotted lines indicate the times of the
corresponding 2-km altitude horizontal cross sections. The gray
shaded region is where SEA-POL was not transmitting and
collecting observations, which changes with ship heading.
Times where no solar radiation is affecting the cloud
distribution sare denoted for reference. Both color bars use
increments of 2 dBZ; however, the evolution of the median
reflectivity and the cross sections use slightly different color
bars because of the differences in the range of values. From
Trabing and Bell (2021)
