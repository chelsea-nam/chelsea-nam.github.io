    <p> Hi there! I am a Sejong science postdoctoral fellow working at <a href="https://www.atmos.colostate.edu/">Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University (CSU)</a> and <a href="http://care.knu.ac.kr/home/">Center for Atmospheric REmote sensing (CARE), Kyungpook Nat'l University (KNU)</a>. </p>
    <p> I graduated from PhD at CSU in 2021 fall under supervision of Prof. Michael Bell. During my PhD, I studied convective structure evolution during tropical cyclone genesis in sheared and dry environments.
      To better understand the complex, multi-scale tropical cyclogenesis, I used a number of different datasets and methods including radar (airborne, shipborne) data, ensemble high-resolution mesoscale models (WRF and CM1)
      and large-scale reanalyses. Visit <a href ="https://chelsea-nam.github.io/publications/">my publicaiton list</a>. </p>
    <p> I received a B.S in earth science from Seoul National University (SNU) at South Korea in 2015, and M.S in atmospheric science from SNU in 2017. During my Masterâ€™s, I researched TC risk in statistical and climatological perspective working with Dr. Chang-Hoi Ho and Dr. Doo-Sun R. Park. </p>
    <p> I have a passion for teaching. I completed the graduate teaching certificate program at CSU while serving an instructor for the undergraduate Intro course for atmospheric science at CSU in 2019 and as a teaching assistant for Atmospheric Dynamics II course in 2020. </p>
