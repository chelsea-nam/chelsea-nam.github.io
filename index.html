    <p> Hi there! Our research group in the Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences
      at Florida State University. The group's current research includes: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Tropical Cyclone Genesis and Intensification</li>
        <li>Tropical Cyclone Microphysics </li>
        <li>Compound Hazards induced by Tropical Cyclones </li>
      </ul>

      <p>To better understand the complex, multi-scale mechanisms around tropical cyclones, we use a number of different datasets
        and methods including radar (airborne, shipborne and land-based) data, ensemble high-resolution mesoscale models (WRF and CM1)
      and large-scale reanalyses.</p>
