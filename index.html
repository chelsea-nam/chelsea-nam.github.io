    <p> Hi there! I am an assistant professor of meteorology at Florida State University. I joined FSU in Spring 2024, and before that I worked as a Sejong science postdoctoral fellow at Colorado State University (CSU) and Kyungpook Nat'l University (KNU). </p>
    <p> I graduated from PhD at CSU in 2021 fall under supervision of Prof. Michael Bell. During my PhD, I studied convective structure evolution during tropical cyclone genesis in sheared and dry environments.
      To better understand the complex, multi-scale tropical cyclogenesis, I used a number of different datasets and methods including radar (airborne, shipborne) data, ensemble high-resolution mesoscale models (WRF and CM1)
      and large-scale reanalyses. Visit <a href ="https://chelsea-nam.github.io/publications/">my publicaiton list</a>. </p>
    <p> Current research includes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Tropical Cyclone genesis and intensification</li>
  <li>Tropical Cyclone microphysics </li>
  <li>Monsoon and Tropical Cyclone interactions</li>
</ul>
